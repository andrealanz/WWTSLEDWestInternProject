# WWT SLED West Intern Project 2019
## Two Concurrent Projects Include:
1) Internal web app tool for WWT sales team that normalizes quote files from vendors into one csv file according to WWT ISR format standards. We used a front-end R ShinyApp to select files to convert, display, and download. The ShinyApp leverages our Python program on the back-end to re-format the data. 

2) Internal web app tool for Matthew Jenkins, SLED West Director, and his Account Managers. This app is an R ShinyApp that reads in data from a raw Backlog Order Summary csv file and creates an interactive pie chart that displays only the most important data in a simple design for quick information gathering. There are future possibilities for visualizing the data and performing analytics.

Both projects are deployed on AWS for cost-effective and easy access.
